Hold me forever, whisper the words
I've waited so long to hear
Love's sweet surrender, steals an embrace
And kisses away the tears

Lookin' back down the road of love
We can still feel the heartache
Pain and joy of an unrelenting love
Hold us together

Only you, you've got control
Only you, you've got the key to my heart
Only you, you've got control
Need your love, take me forever

Sad empty faces, faded away
When I fell in love with you
True love erases fear and the doubt
Not knowing we'd see things through

So in love, unaware of time
In a world of illusion
We fell in love until the end of time
True love, forever

Only you, you've got control
Only you, you've got the key to my heart
Only you, you've got control
Need your love, need your love, baby

Lookin' back down the road of love
We can still feel the heartache
Pain and joy of an unrelenting love
Hold us together

Only you, you've got control
Only you, you've got the key to my heart
Only you, you've got control
Need your love, take me forever

Only you, you've got control
Only you, you've got the key to my heart
Only you, you've got control
Need your love, I need it, baby, forever only you
