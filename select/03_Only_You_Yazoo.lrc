[00:08.85] Looking from a window above
[00:12.28] It's like a story of love
[00:15.65] Can you hear me?
[00:18.41] Came back only yesterday
[00:21.18] I'm moving farther away
[00:24.03] Want you near me
[00:32.03] 
[00:27.92] All I needed was the love you gave
[00:32.75] All I needed for another day
[00:36.07] And all I ever knew
[00:39.38] Only you
[00:43.38] 
[00:45.50] Sometimes, when I think of her name
[00:48.28] When it's only a game
[00:51.03] And I need you
[00:55.02] Listen to the words that you say
[00:57.28] It's getting harder to stay
[01:00.69] When I see you
[01:07.69] 
[01:04.20] All I needed was the love you gave
[01:08.50] All I needed for another day
[01:12.56] And all I ever knew
[01:16.13] Only you
[01:20.13] 
[01:40.36] All I needed was the love you gave
[01:44.32] All I needed for another day
[01:48.85] And all I ever knew
[01:51.96] Only you
[01:55.96] 
[01:57.48] This is gonna take a long time
[02:00.57] And I wonder what's mine
[02:03.36] Can't take no more (can't take no more)
[02:07.17] Wonder if you'll understand
[02:09.56] It's just the touch of your hand
[02:12.92] Behind a closed door
[02:22.92] 
[02:16.52] All I needed was the love you gave
[02:21.06] All I needed for another day
[02:24.85] And all I ever knew (all I ever knew)
[02:29.19] Only you
