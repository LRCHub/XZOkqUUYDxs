I remember those times
Of chasing hearts in the night
So many times
Love was gone with the morning light

But since you came
The door has opened inside
And I'm not the same

Since the day you caught my eye
And everyday
I've been playing a role
I was always in control
What came my way
Since you came

It's like I'm floating on air
I don't feel the same
You've won my heart baby this I swear

Heaven knows you've changed my life
Only you
Out of the blue
Only you
Like an angel through the night

Like an angel through the night

Heaven knows you've reached my mind
All my life
Out of the blue
I could make it on my own
I've been living alone
Always got by
Then you came

Emotion start running so wild
My life has changed
Faster then the speed of light

Only you
Heaven knows you've changed my life
Like an angel through the night
Heaven knows you've reached my mind
Out of the blue
Only you
Like an angel through the night
Out of the blue
